                <!--<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
                <p>In a constantly evolving music industry, record labels maintained a continuous grip on a large market share within the space. They have been forced to adapt to a changing environment, to the point where they are almost unrecognisable from a couple of decades ago. Still, despite their transition, they have come into scrutiny from many artists and music fans with a major modern shift in public opinion. From being considered essential to the developmental stages of artists’ careers, they are now considered by many to be exploitative and unnecessary for success.</p>
                <p>A survey conducted by Murilex saw 28% of respondents expressing negative views about modern record labels, while 20.5% had a positive outlook. We hypothesise that this is the result of an increased mainstream criticism of these labels, both by music artists and large media outlets. This highlights a developing divergence in public opinion, and larger speculation on what exactly these labels do.</p>
                <h3>Role of Record Labels</h3>
                <p>There are different types of labels, including major and indie labels, but I will choose to focus on the former. Major record labels, in some instances dubbed the ‘Big Three’, account for the majority of market share, monopolising the music industry. Once the artist has been signed, these labels perform different functions to aid artists achieve success in return for copyright and royalty payments, which has led to much of the recent debate.</p>
                <p>Distribution: Record labels outsource their distribution to aggregators or distributors, paying them a fee in return for music distribution. Aggregators will ensure that an artist’s music is available on each digital platform, while distributors may choose to provide marketing on top of aggregation.</p>
                <p>Mixing and Mastering: Having many producers at their disposal, major labels are able to provide creative opportunities to artists, while enabling connections that may benefit their music in the long run.</p>
                <p>PR and Promotion: Most likely the primary incentive for artists to sign with a label is their extensive network and funds to promote the artist and prompt their success. At least, this was their main advantage before the explosive impact of social media platforms.</p>
                <p>Visual Artwork: The visual aspect of music has often been underappreciated in the past. Labels ensure that artists have all the necessary resources to make covers, videos or any other artwork they seek.</p>
                <p>Though labels can prove to be pivotal in an artist’s career, many choose to remain independent. Too often is it reported that artists sign unfavourable deals with exploitative royalty splits, influencing them to choose independence over signing with music labels. The prospects of becoming successful without relying on labels are more promising than ever before, reflected with the increasing market share of independent artists.</p>
                <h3>Rise of Independent Artists</h3>
                <p>According to Midia Research, recorded music revenues for self-releasing ‘artists direct’ grew by 25% to $1.5bn in 2021. This reflects an overall trend: independent artists are seeing gains like never before. Through social media platforms, artists have a unique opportunity to build their success from the ground up. They get to sign contracts later in their development, or avoid signing them completely.</p>
                <p>In 2017, the major labels and Merlin, a digital rights licensing partner for independent labels, accounted for 87% of Spotify’s streams, falling to a staggering 75% in 2022 (musically). This statistic indicates that listeners are finding artists that are not associated with labels easier than before, leading a wave of independent music artists to success. Independent artists are finding their footing in the technological space, detaching themselves from industrial standards we have observed for generations.</p>
                <p>The Midia Research study continues to note that in 2020, independent revenue on an ‘ownership’ basis grew by 12%, matching the trend of independent artist growth. It concludes that both independent labels and artists are growing faster than the total market, hence increasing market share. Higher returns from streaming paired with a greater presence on social media, it has never been a better time to be an independent artist.</p>
                <p>However, independent record labels’ scale is insufficient to both licence and distribute directly to streaming services, as they require large funds and networks. These are thus reliant on the marketplace of digital distributors, who are grown accustomed to this side of the business. It would be interesting to see the sort of opportunities that arise for independent artists and investors given the current structure.</p>
                <h3>Decentralisation of Music</h3>
                <P>In my opinion, the primary roles that record labels play can be found in a single manager or a small team, replacing labels with specialised organisations. Artists can now seek help in various areas through different channels, instead of relying on a single entity to govern these decisions and charging unnecessary royalties. With the growth of Murilex and other music royalty trading platforms, music labels will lose their positions as music market drivers, rendering them useless as independent artists are given the chance to thrive in a new, decentralised market.</P>
                <p>The rise in independent artists means that labels are losing out on market share, slowly losing monopoly power in the music industry. As the co-founder of Murilex, I strongly believe that with this ongoing decentralisation of music, record labels will become obsolete in their modern form. An increasingly negative outlook on labels discussed earlier, combined with success attainable through remaining independent, will draw artists away from signing contracts, especially if alternative funding methods make their way to the mainstream. </p>
                <p>This is especially the case as artists continue to speak out against their unfair treatment by major labels. More recently, music artists including Halsey and Charlie Puth, spoke out about the pressures they face from their labels when it came to posting on social media (Variety Magazine). The way I see it, as record labels proceed to diverge public opinion, the music industry will face a reshuffling of market power as it searches for more efficient ways to provide artists with necessary support. A positive change, as independent artists will see the most gains with this increase of bargaining power, forcing labels to offer more attractive and accommodating terms for artists who still wish to be signed.</p>
                <h3>Labels Will Adapt</h3>
                <p>Although I suggested that labels are not the way of the future for the music industry, they can still adapt and take on different forms. One possibility is that, instead of providing all services, they will specialise in different areas to better segment and appeal to artists. Independent artists will avoid corporations dictating all their decisions, but they may outsource certain record label functions to these new organisations.</p>
                <p>This is already noticeable in the rise of the digital distribution platforms, as it is difficult for a single artist to grant licensing and to keep track of all the streaming platforms. But it also means that managerial teams will become more important, as creators take control of their artistic freedom. This new distribution of resources in the music industry will prove to benefit the artists, and labels will have no choice but to adapt.</p>
                <p>Major labels will see a significant drop in market share in the not so distant future, but independent labels will continue to undergo year on year growth. They have shown to be the future for independent artists, and an example of the type of music labels we will encounter more often than not. Already, these labels are being marketed to be for artists who wish to keep 100% of their profits, retain master rights and have creative control over their music (Icon Collective). These labels are an example of the new driving force of the music industry: appealing to independent creators.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>In summation, the modern music industry is witnessing a significant transformation. Record labels, once considered essential for artists' success, are facing increased scrutiny and competition from independent artists who harness the power of social media and digital platforms. As the market share shifts in favour of independent creators, traditional record labels are evolving to adapt to this changing landscape. The future may see labels specialising in specific services and offering more artist-friendly terms, while independent artists gain greater control and a larger share of the music market. Ultimately, the music industry is undergoing a decentralisation process that promises a more diverse and artist-centric landscape.</p>
