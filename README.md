Murilex: Music Royalties for Retail Investors

Murilex was an early-stage concept for a platform that would allow retail investors to buy, sell, and trade shares of music royalties â€” turning songs into investable assets. Built by a small team of students passionate about music, fintech, and innovation, the project aimed to democratize access to royalty-based passive income typically reserved for labels and funds.

Project Vision:

- Our goal was to build a transparent, accessible marketplace where anyone could:

- Invest in songs or catalogs and earn a share of streaming revenue

- Discover new artists based on financial performance

- Support creators while benefiting from their success

Status:

Murilex was developed as a passion project while we were in university. Although we chose not to pursue it commercially due to time and market competition, we learned a lot and wanted to share our work publicly for inspiration, feedback, or future collaboration.
